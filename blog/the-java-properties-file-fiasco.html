    <h1><a href='/'>~/</a> The Java .properties file fiasco</h1>
  </nav>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    My task for today was to integrate a Git library into my blog app. I had a skeleton hand-rolled Java Android app with no build system -- only a Makefile. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Searching the web, I came across <em>JGit</em>. It was written in Java and was near the top of Google Search. So I went with it. I asked ChatGPT what else I would need to add it as a dependency. It recommended <code>slf4j</code>, whatever that means. I was new to the Java ecosystem, so I just did what it told me to (I didn't want to waste any more time on a project only I'd use).
  </p>
  <p>
    After downloading the JARs, I updated the Makefile so that <code>d8</code> includes them in the compilation step. When I ran the app, it gave me an error:
  </p>
  <div class='code lang-console'><pre>Error: Translation bundle could not be found for [org.eclipse.jgit.internal.JGitText, en_US]
</pre></div>
  <p>
    I ChatGPTed the error and found it was due to a missing <code>JGitText.properties</code> file. I didn't have a whole lot of experience working with JARs, so I extracted the <code>.jar</code> archive and searched for the file. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Surprisingly, the <code>JGitText.properties</code> file existed and was at the right location in the JAR, so I asked my AI guru what the problem could be. It said that for the particular locale, a <code>JGitText_en_US.properties</code> file needs to exist, but also said that if the file is not found, <code>JGitText.properties</code> should be the fallback and will be used instead. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I rechecked that the fallback file existed, and ran the app several times, copying the file with <code>_en_US</code> and <code>_en</code> suffixes between the runs. But it still didn't work. Neither the US English locale file nor the fallback file was being loaded by JGit at runtime.
  </p>
  <p>
    I suspected that <code>d8</code> has something to do with it; maybe it's just converting the <code>.class</code> files in the JAR into <code>classes.dex</code>, and ignoring the <code>.properties</code> files in the JAR altogether. I once again asked my AI guru about it, and it asserted that indeed <code>d8</code> skips files not ending with <code>.class</code>, even if you specify the whole <code>.jar</code> file to <code>d8</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now here's where the AI ran into a frenzy. It told me to add the <code>.properties</code> files to the <code>.jar</code> <em>before</em> the dex step. But hold on: the JAR file already has the <code>.properties</code> files in it! I updated the <code>.jar</code> to have multiple copies of <code>JGitText.properties</code> with different suffixes for locales. Even if working with a single <code>JGitText.properties</code> file, it should already be present in the JAR, but the AI thinks it's not. Even after telling that the files exist in the JAR, it still prints the previous unhelpful output.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the end, I got to work. The fix was much simpler: I copied the <code>.properties</code> files in the JAR <em>with the parent directories</em>, to the root of my project, and put in under a folder called <code>properties</code>. Just appending the newly-created <code>properties</code> directory path to <code>aapt</code> made it work. Unzipping the APK, I could now see the <code>org/eclipse/jgit/internal</code> directory with the <code>.properties</code> files inside.
