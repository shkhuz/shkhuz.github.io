Abascia is an RPN-based android calculator for everyday tasks. 

## Why another RPN calculator?

One crucial feature I've seen that is absent from almost all other RPN 
calculators<sup><small>1</small></sup> (dealbreaker for me personally) is the 
ability to see the history of calculations -- what pieces is the final answer composed of.

Without it, there's no way to check if the result is free from any mistakes while
calculating the answer. At least an algebraic calculator will let you see this history,
even if it's limited to only one calculation at any time. 

This calculator combines the efficiency and intuitiveness of RPN, and the display/outputs of
an algebraic calculator.

Note: When installing the .apk file, Play Protect may show a popup something like "Play 
Protect doesn't recognise this app's developer. Apps from unknown developers can 
sometimes be unsafe." -- this is because I have not published the app to the Play
Store. It is completely safe to install.
