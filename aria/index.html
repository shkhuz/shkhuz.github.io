<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>A lot of the language features were inspired or taken over from Rust &amp; Zig. However, both of them fill a niche of people that I am not a part of.</p>
<p>Rust is over-engineered, and feels lile a feature-bloat now (some C++ developers might not agree). Zig came close, but I had <em>some</em> problems. After mailing Andrew about these nitpicks and never getting a reply back, I decided to implement a compiler — just for fun.</p>
<p>One gripe I had about C was its header system: it was a mess. I decided to keep the basic feature set of C and add a tiny module system.</p>
<p>As macros were a pain for debugging, I reiterated over the Zig’s <code>comptime</code> feature. In Zig, functions can accept types as arguments, but I didn’t like that idea because of <code>extern</code> functions and FFI stuff.</p>
<p>I decided to implement a <code>macro</code> statement, which can accept an AST node as an argument. How it differs from a traditional macro is that it does not modify the AST — it modifies the generated machine code. This small change makes it possible to namespace macros and package it into a module.</p>
<p>Of course, compile-time asserts and conditionals are possible in regular functions too.</p>
<p>One thing Zig implemented perfectly is the error-handling mechanism. A small addition to the return type of a function makes it possible to handle errors in a clean and runtime-safe way.</p>
<p>I decided to do the same in Aria, but felt the need of naming errors sets to be redundant.</p>
<p>Rust had another syntactical element which hoped to increase developer productivity. As naming variables is hard, variables in Rust can be redeclared in the <em>same</em> scope—and with a different type too.</p>
<p>As the compiler does not warn about this redeclaration (as far as I know), I worried about name collisions going unnoticed and creating hard-to-trace bugs. For this, I decided to introduce a keyword <code>redef</code> that redeclares something in the same scope, when the programmer consciously wants to do it. It might seem like a naive design choice, but if it reduces bugs, I’m on it.</p>
<h2 id="building">Building</h2>
<p><del>As the project is not fully mature yet, I have decided to build the compiler in private — once the compiler is able to bootstrap itself, I will release the repository online.</del> I have now decided to release the repository earlier than planned due to multiple collaborators working on it.</p>
