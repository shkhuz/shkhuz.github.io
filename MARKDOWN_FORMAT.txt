The markdown format used in this repository is a little different than the
standard markdown grammar.

# Title                     <-- title

===                         <-- mandatory if nav list is needed
- [Home](/)                 <-- navigation list
- [About](/about)
===                         <-- end nav list

~~~                         <-- emits a table of contents.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit       <-- regular text

[[[                         
Lorem ipsum dolor sit       <-- aside text
consectetur adipiscing

                                  ! -> wrap text
                                  * -> generate callout highlight
                                       any line containing "hlt-start" will be 
                                       discarded and highlight will begin until 
                                       "hlt-end" is found. "hlt-end" will also be 
                                       discarded, so source files can with a comment
                                       mark starting and ending lines without worrying 
                                       about syntax/keyword conflicts.
